NEW COURSE FOR SPRING 2011 !!!
Undergraduate Research Seminar:
Remote Sensing, Signal Processing and Spatial Data Analysis
(ECEN 4004, M/W 3:30-4:45 in ECCR 137, 3 credit hours)
Faculty: Dr. Ute Herzfeld, Associate Research Professor, ECEE
Explore new topics like a research team:
– remote sensing of the environment
– Earth observation technology
– passive and active microwave
– spatial data analysis
– signal processing
– image analysis, interpolation and extrapolation
– new technology for observations from satellites, manned and unmanned aircraft
– instrument and survey design
– fascinating applications: Greenland and Antarctica, ice sheets, oceans, climate change,
˜     forests, ecology, exploration and mining,......
Things to know:
– course style will be centered on research, problem-solving and skill development
– you need not have background in remote sensing or spatial statistics.
– course counts as technical or general elective
– learn skills that prepare for a job at CU and in the professional world
WHO? UNDERGRADUATES
– in: ECEE, AES,...all engineering majors, (applied) mathematics, computer sciences, physics,
˜ physical sciences including PAOS, geology, geography, environmental sciences, glaciology,
˜ geophysics, ecology and hydrology
– enthusiasm and interest are more important than speciﬁc course background
– you need: about 15 credit hours towards your degree (such as basic engineering, maths,
˜ computer ﬁtness, and/or science)
Assessments:
homeworks and a special project on a topic of your choice (1 or 2 students per project)
